## What You Need to Do: Quick Setup Guide ‚ö°

Ready to take your co-op job search to the next level? Here's how to get started:

1. **Prepare the Documents:**
    *   **Crucially**, have your latest **resume** and **transcript** already uploaded to MySuccess. The script currently only tailors your cover letter for each application and uses your most recently uploaded resume and transcript from MySuccess.
2. **Organize Your Files:**
    *   **All important information you must provide is in the folder "./data_folder/input/"**.
    *   Place your PDF resume in the `/resume` folder. MySuccessAutomation will intelligently extract personal information about you, like skills, experience, education, and more, to personalize your applications.
3. **Configure Your Preferences:** `personal_information.yaml`
The `personal_information.yaml` file is where you provide your personal details and customize your job search preferences. This file is crucial for tailoring your applications and cover letters. Here's a breakdown of each field:

*   **`keywords`**:
    *   This section defines the keywords that MySuccessAutomation will use to filter job postings on Carleton's MySuccess portal.
    *   Add keywords that match your desired job titles, skills, or industries.
    *   Be as specific or general as you like. For example, you can use "Software Engineer," "Data Science," "Machine Learning," "AWS," or "Web Development."
    *   Add each keyword on a new line, indented with two spaces, and preceded by a hyphen (`-`).
*   **`name`**:
    *   Enter your first name here.
*   **`surname`**:
    *   Enter your last name here.
*   **`email`**:
    *   Enter your email address. This will be used in your cover letters and applications.
*   **`phone`**:
    *   Enter your phone number. This will be used in your cover letters and applications.
*   **`linkedin`**:
    *   Enter the full URL of your LinkedIn profile. This will be used in your cover letters and applications.
*   **`github`**:
    *   Enter the full URL of your GitHub profile. This will be used in your cover letters and applications.
*   **`portfolio`**:
    *   Enter the full URL of your personal portfolio website. This will be used in your cover letters and applications.

**Important Notes:**

*   Do not delete any fields (keys) in the `./data_folder/input/personal_information.yaml` file, even if you don't want to use them.
*   If you don't want to include a particular field, leave its value blank (e.g., `portfolio: ""`).
*   Ensure that the file is correctly formatted according to YAML syntax. You can use online YAML validators to check for errors.
*   **Example:**

    ```yaml
    keywords:
      - "Python"
      - "Software Development"
      - "Machine Learning"
      - "AWS"

    name: "YourName"
    surname: "YourSurname"
    email: "your.email@example.com"
    phone: "123-456-7890"
    linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile/"
    github: "https://github.com/yourusername"
    portfolio: ""
    ```
### 4. Providing Your Credentials Securely: `secrets.yaml`

The `secrets.yaml` file is where you store sensitive credentials required for MySuccessAutomation to operate. **Your security is a top priority.** This information is stored locally on your machine and is never transmitted externally.

**Important:** This file is named `secrets.yaml` and is located in the `./data_folder/input/` directory.

Here's a breakdown of the required fields:

*   **`CARLETON_USERNAME`**:
    *   Enter your Carleton University MySuccess username as a string.
    *   **Example:**  `CARLETON_USERNAME: "your_username"`
*   **`CARLETON_PASSWORD`**:
    *   Enter your Carleton University MySuccess password as a string.
    *   **Example:** `CARLETON_PASSWORD: "your_password"`
*   **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`**:
    *   Enter your Google API key as a string. This is used for accessing Google's AI services (Gemini). (this is pretty much just OPENAI's chatgpt but its COMPLETELY FREE for a api key as oposed to open ai. If you have a OPENAI api key or prefer to wish that please leave GOOGLE_API_KEY blank and uncomment/fill the OPENAI_API_KEY in the super_duper_secrets.yaml file)
    *   You can obtain a free API key by signing up here: [https://aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
    *   **Example:** `GOOGLE_API_KEY: "your_api_key"`

**Security Considerations:**

*   **Local Storage:** All data in `super_duper_secrets.yaml` is processed and stored **exclusively on your local machine**.
*   **No External Transmission:** Your credentials are **never sent to any external servers or services.**
*   **.gitignore:** The `super_duper_secrets.yaml` file is included in the project's `.gitignore` file. This prevents it from being accidentally committed to your Git repository, ensuring your credentials remain private.
*   **Responsibility** While this project takes measures to protect your data locally, always be cautious when handling sensitive information.

**Example `super_duper_secrets.yaml`:**

```yaml
CARLETON_USERNAME: "BugsBunny"  # Replace with your Carleton username
CARLETON_PASSWORD: "MySuperSecurePassword"  # Replace with your Carleton password
GOOGLE_API_KEY: "AIzaSyDOC-your_key_here-V2vB"  # Replace with your Google API key


> **Personal Note from the Developer:**
Apologies for the delayed release. Juggling a major project i've yet to release, school, and work commitments has been quite the challenge. I haven't personally used MySuccessAutomation in 2024, but only because I'm not in the co-op program this year for unrelated reasons. For any employeers or people willing to refer me : I'm open to work opportunities for the summer of 2025 though! #SomeonePleaseGiveMeAJob
